This repo is to hold the rehash version of the game created during my time at UWM, using a slightly different concept. 
My purpose in doing this project is to retouch with the basic principles and concepts of C#, .NET, and OOP. 

TODO: 
I plan to extend the current game build to restart the game every time the player finishes if they want, or press a specific key to exit. 
For now, the game is linear. Once you either die or finish the game, it exits.
